Description: # Spotify Web Sockets
        
        ## Description
        
        The main purpose of this project is to let the users interact with
        spotify web socket events. Right now the project is still in an alpha version therefore is not complete and may have some bugs.
        Feel free to contribute is any way.
        
        ## Basic library usage
        
        Example using chrome cookies
        
        ```python
        
        from spotifyws.spotify import SpotifyWs
        
        client = SpotifyWs()
        
        @client.on('track')
        def on_track_change(data):
            print('TRACK CHANGED')
        
        ```
        
        Example using cookies from custom file
        
        ```python
        
        from spotifyws.spotify import SpotifyWs
        
        client = SpotifyWs(cookie_file="./cookie_file.json")
        
        @client.on('track')
        def on_track_change(data):
            print('TRACK CHANGED')
        
        ```
        
        ## Launch flask example
        
        In order to launch flask example you need the following commands:
        
        ```bash
        $ export FLASK_APP=examples.flask-app.server
        $ flask run
        ```
        
        ## About authentication
        
        Right now authentication can only be achieved using local cookies and not through OAUTH flow.
        
        ## Note
        
        This code is intended for learning purposes only.
        You must know that bypassing spotify API is against theirs Terms of service therefore I don't invite you to abuse this library.
        Thanks
